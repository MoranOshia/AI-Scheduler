Our Project:<br>
The idea is to program an intelligent system that will compute a work schedule for workers based on their roles, preferences, restrictions, etc. Eventually the system will try to learn the optimal work schedule for each worker and suggest it to them.  However, it is not possible for the system to give an optimal answer for each worker every single time because circumstances can change, so it will have the ability to compromise and make changes accordingly.  We will try to achieve this by implementing machine learning algorithms and data analysis methods.
